1,Full Context,1000,What is the boiling point of water at sea level?,100,"To determine the boiling point of water at sea level, we need to refer to standard atmospheric conditions. The boiling point of water is typically defined as the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure surrounding the liquid. At sea level, the standard atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 atmosphere (atm).

Under these conditions, the boiling point of water is:

100 degrees Celsius (Celsius scale)
212 degrees Fahrenheit (Fahrenheit scale)

This is based on the standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm, which is equivalent to about 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). This value is considered the standard for defining the boiling point of water at sea level.

It's important to note that the boiling point of water can vary slightly with changes in altitude and atmospheric pressure. For example, at higher elevations, the boiling point of water decreases because the atmospheric pressure is lower. Conversely, at lower elevations or under increased pressure, the boiling point of water increases.",35.08796811103821,1

Fleming published his findings in 1928, describing the phenomenon as ""a new antibiotic substance produced by a fungus."" However, it wasn't until Howard Florey and Ernst Chain further developed the process of mass-producing penicillin during World War II that it became widely used for treating bacterial infections.

1,Zero Context,0,Which artist cut off his own ear?,van gogh,"Vincent van Gogh, the Dutch post-impressionist painter, famously cut off part of his own ear in December 1888. The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37.

2,Full Context,1000,What is the boiling point of water at sea level?,100,"To determine the boiling point of water at sea level, we need to refer to standard atmospheric conditions. The boiling point of water is typically defined as the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure surrounding the liquid. At sea level, the standard atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 atmosphere (atm).

Under these conditions, the boiling point of water is:

100 degrees Celsius (Celsius scale)
212 degrees Fahrenheit (Fahrenheit scale)

This is based on the standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm, which is equivalent to about 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). This value is considered the standard for defining the boiling point of water at sea level.

It's important to note that the boiling point of water can vary slightly with changes in altitude and atmospheric pressure. For example, at higher elevations, the boiling point of water decreases because the atmospheric pressure is lower. Conversely, at lower elevations or under increased pressure, the boiling point of water increases.",35.050254106521606,1

2,Full Context,500,What is the chemical symbol for water?,h2o,"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided:

1. The passage mentions ""the case of the Milanese Leonardo,"" referring to Leonardo da Vinci, an Italian artist, scientist, and inventor who lived in Milan during the Renaissance period.
2. It states that ""practically every fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,"" implying that Florence was a significant center for artistic activity during that time.
3. The passage then contrasts Florence with Milan, suggesting that despite Milan being ""just as big,"" it did not produce artists at the same rate as Florence.

From this context, we can infer that the city of Florence was a hub for artistic talent and creativity during the fifteenth century. Given the passage's emphasis on artistic figures, it's reasonable to assume that the city sent a message encouraging artistic ambition and achievement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the chemical symbol for Florence is ""Fe."" This is a playful reference to iron (Fe), as Florence is often referred to as the ""City of Iron"" due to its historical significance in iron production and trade. The metaphorical use of ""Fe"" here represents the idea that Florence was a central and influential city in fostering artistic talent, akin to how iron is a crucial material in various industries and applications.",41.14603114128113,0

- **Silicon Valley**: ""you should be more powerful.""

The text then poses the question, ""How much does it matter what message a city sends?"" and suggests that the answer is significant based on historical evidence. It provides an example of Leonardo da Vinci, also known as Leonardo of Milan, who was part of the Renaissance movement centered in Florence during the 15th century. Despite Milan being a large city, many notable figures from that era were from Florence, indicating the strong influence of the city's cultural and intellectual environment on its residents' aspirations and achievements.

Mount Everest was first surveyed by the Great Trigonometric Survey of India in 1856, which estimated its height to be 8,840 meters (29,000 ft). This measurement was later refined by various expeditions, with the most accurate being the 1954 Chinese survey, which measured the height to be 8,848 meters (29,029 ft).

In 1999, a joint Chinese-Nepalese expedition used satellite technology to measure the height of Mount Everest again, and confirmed the height to be 8,848 meters (29,031 ft), which is the figure commonly accepted today.

So, while the exact height of Mount Everest may vary slightly depending on the method of measurement, it remains the tallest mountain in the world, towering over the landscape at an impressive 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level.",43.20998668670654,1

Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

3,Full Context,500,What is the chemical symbol for water?,h2o,"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided:

1. The passage mentions ""the case of the Milanese Leonardo,"" referring to Leonardo da Vinci, an Italian artist, scientist, and inventor who lived in Milan during the Renaissance period.
2. It states that ""practically every fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,"" implying that Florence was a significant center for artistic activity during that time.
3. The passage then contrasts Florence with Milan, suggesting that despite Milan being ""just as big,"" it did not produce artists at the same rate as Florence.

From this context, we can infer that the city of Florence was a hub for artistic talent and creativity during the fifteenth century. Given the passage's emphasis on artistic figures, it's reasonable to assume that the city sent a message encouraging artistic ambition and achievement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the chemical symbol for Florence is ""Fe."" This is a playful reference to iron (Fe), as Florence is often referred to as the ""City of Iron"" due to its historical significance in iron production and trade. The metaphorical use of ""Fe"" here represents the idea that Florence was a central and influential city in fostering artistic talent, akin to how iron is a crucial material in various industries and applications.",41.507444858551025,0

4. It states that despite differences in population size, certain cities seem to disproportionately attract and nurture talent, suggesting a strong influence of the city's ethos on its residents' achievements.

- **Silicon Valley**: ""you should be more powerful.""

The text then poses the question, ""How much does it matter what message a city sends?"" and suggests that the answer is significant based on historical evidence. It provides an example of Leonardo da Vinci, also known as Leonardo of Milan, who was part of the Renaissance movement centered in Florence during the 15th century. Despite Milan being a large city, many notable figures from that era were from Florence, indicating the strong influence of the city's cultural and intellectual environment on its residents' aspirations and achievements.

Blue whales can grow up to 100 feet (30 meters) in length and weigh between 200,000 to 360,000 kilograms (440,925 to 791,200 pounds). They are found in all of the world's oceans, although their distribution is seasonal and varies by population. They feed primarily on krill, which they filter out of the water using baleen plates in their mouths.

These majestic creatures play a crucial role in marine ecosystems as they help regulate the populations of krill and other small marine organisms. However, they were hunted extensively for their oil, meat, and baleen during the 20th century, leading to a significant decline in their population. Conservation efforts have helped to recover some populations, but they are still considered an endangered species due to the lingering effects of past overhunting and ongoing threats such as ship strikes and pollution.",39.70387411117554,1

The boiling point of water is typically defined as the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure surrounding the liquid. At sea level, the standard atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 atmosphere (atm).

Under these conditions, the boiling point of water is:

100 degrees Celsius (Celsius scale)
212 degrees Fahrenheit (Fahrenheit scale)

This is based on the standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm, which is equivalent to about 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). This value is considered the standard for defining the boiling point of water at sea level.

It's important to note that the boiling point of water can vary slightly with changes in altitude and atmospheric pressure. For example, at higher elevations, the boiling point of water decreases because the atmospheric pressure is lower.
