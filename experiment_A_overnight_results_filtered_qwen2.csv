The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

Diamonds are formed under high pressure and temperature conditions deep within the Earth's mantle, typically from carbon-rich materials. They are composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a crystal lattice structure, making them incredibly hard and durable. This property makes diamonds valuable for various applications, including jewelry, industrial cutting tools, and high-precision instruments.

In terms of hardness, diamonds are rated as having a 10 on the Mohs scale, which is the standard for measuring the relative hardness of minerals. This scale ranges from 1 (softest, like talc) to 10 (hardest, like diamond), with diamond being the highest-rated mineral."

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.
- **Florence**: The passage mentions that practically every fifteenth-century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, suggesting that it was a hub for artistic talent during that period.

The passage also discusses the idea that the environment or city one lives in can significantly influence one's ambitions and opportunities. It suggests that certain cities, like Cambridge, attract people who are interested in living in close proximity to the smartest people, despite the challenges such as high cost of living, grubbiness, and bad weather.

Regarding the question of whether the environment can shape one's ambitions, the author seems to suggest that it can, and that it might be more effective to leverage the environment rather than fighting against it. The author uses the example of Leonardo da Vinci being unable to ""beat the force of environment"" in Milan, implying that the environment plays a significant role in shaping one's opportunities and potential for success.

In conclusion, the passage highlights the diverse messages that different cities send and the influence these messages can have on individual ambitions and career paths.

1,3,Full Context,1000,What is the square root of 64?,20.377723932266235,1,"To find the square root of 64, we need to determine the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 64.

Let's calculate:

$ \sqrt{64} = ? $

We are looking for a number $x$ such that $x \times x = 64$. 

By trial and error or recalling our multiplication tables, we find that:

$ 8 \times 8 = 64 $

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.
- **Florence**: The passage mentions that practically every fifteenth-century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, suggesting that it was a hub for artistic talent during that period.

The passage also discusses the idea that the environment or city one lives in can significantly influence one's ambitions and opportunities. It suggests that certain cities, like Cambridge, attract people who are interested in living in close proximity to the smartest people, despite the challenges such as high cost of living, grubbiness, and bad weather.

Regarding the question of whether the environment can shape one's ambitions, the author seems to suggest that it can, and that it might be more effective to leverage the environment rather than fighting against it. The author uses the example of Leonardo da Vinci being unable to ""beat the force of environment"" in Milan, implying that the environment plays a significant role in shaping one's opportunities and potential for success.

In conclusion, the passage highlights the diverse messages that different cities send and the influence these messages can have on individual ambitions and career paths. It also implies that the environment, especially in intellectually stimulating cities like Cambridge, can be a powerful force in shaping one's life and opportunities."

It has an elevation of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level.

The mountain was first surveyed by the Great Trigonometric Survey of India in 1856, which estimated its height to be 8,840 meters (29,000 ft). Subsequent surveys using satellite technology and trigonometry gave increasingly accurate figures until 1999, when China and Nepal agreed upon the figure of 8,848 meters (29,029 ft). In May 2005, Chinese surveyors calculated the height of Mount Everest to be 8,844.43 meters (29,017.13 ft) above sea level. This value was later confirmed by a joint Chinese-Nepalese team in 2005, which measured the peak's height to be 8,848.13 meters (29,031.7 ft).

In May 2020, a joint Chinese and Nepalese team announced that they had re-measured the height of Mount Everest and found it to be 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) tall, confirming the previous measurement taken in 2005."

It contains more than half of Earth's water and nearly half of its surface.

The Pacific Ocean covers an area of about 63.1 million square miles (165.2 million square kilometers). It is about 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers) wide at its widest point. The ocean is bordered by the Pacific Ranges of mountains on the north, west, and east. On the south, it borders the Antarctic continent.

The Pacific Ocean is the source of much of the world's weather. Its warm waters influence the climate of many countries. The ocean is also home to a variety of marine life, including whales, dolphins, sharks, and fish. It is also a major shipping route, with many of the world's busiest ports located along its shores.

The Pacific Ocean is divided into several smaller bodies of water, including the Arctic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean. It is also home to many islands, including Hawaii, Japan, and Indonesia. The ocean is also home to many important economic activities, such as fishing, tourism, and shipping.

The Pacific Ocean is also known for its powerful storms, including typhoons and hurricanes. These storms can cause significant damage to coastal areas and can be deadly. However, the ocean also plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate and supporting life on our planet."

These plates are pieces of the Earth's crust and upper mantle that float on the semi-fluid layer beneath, the asthenosphere. They move due to convection currents within the planet's mantle. 

The continents sit atop the plates, and move along with them. This movement causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. The continents themselves are actually broken up into smaller land masses called microcontinents. 

There are seven traditional continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. With the discovery of the Australian continent, the theory of continental drift was confirmed. The theory was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. He noticed that the coastlines of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like puzzle pieces. He also noticed that the rock layers in Greenland and Norway were similar. He concluded that the continents must have once been joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. 

Over millions of years, the continents broke apart and drifted to their current locations. Today, the continents continue to move, albeit very slowly. The continents will eventually collide and form a new supercontinent, called Pangea II, in about 300 million years."

The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

He observed that the area around the mold showed no bacterial growth, which led him to conclude that the mold must be secreting some substance that inhibits bacterial growth.

Fleming published his findings in 1928, describing the phenomenon as ""a new antibiotic substance produced by a fungus."" However, it wasn't until Howard Florey and Ernst Chain further developed the process of mass-producing penicillin during World War II that it became widely used for treating bacterial infections. Their work led to the first clinical use of penicillin in 1941, marking a significant advancement in medicine and saving countless lives during the war."

For example, at higher elevations where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at a lower temperature, typically around 99 degrees Celsius (210.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Conversely, at lower elevations with higher atmospheric pressure, water may boil at a higher temperature, potentially up to about 101.4 degrees Celsius (214.5 degrees Fahrenheit)."
2,3,Zero Context,0,Which artist cut off his own ear?,47.97776675224304,1,"Vincent van Gogh, the Dutch post-impressionist painter, famously cut off part of his own ear in December 1888. The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.
- **Florence**: The passage mentions that practically every fifteenth-century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, suggesting that it was a hub for artistic talent during that period.

The passage also discusses the idea that the environment or city one lives in can significantly influence one's ambitions and opportunities. It suggests that certain cities, like Cambridge, attract people who are interested in living in close proximity to the smartest people, despite the challenges such as high cost of living, grubbiness, and bad weather.

Regarding the question of whether the environment can shape one's ambitions, the author seems to suggest that it can, and that it might be more effective to leverage the environment rather than fighting against it. The author uses the example of Leonardo da Vinci being unable to ""beat the force of environment"" in Milan, implying that the environment plays a significant role in shaping one's opportunities and potential for success.

In conclusion, the passage highlights the diverse messages that different cities send and the influence these messages can have on individual ambitions and career paths.

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.
- **Florence**: The passage mentions that practically every fifteenth-century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, suggesting that it was a hub for artistic talent during that period.

The passage also discusses the idea that the environment or city one lives in can significantly influence one's ambitions and opportunities. It suggests that certain cities, like Cambridge, attract people who are interested in living in close proximity to the smartest people, despite the challenges such as high cost of living, grubbiness, and bad weather.

Regarding the question of whether the environment can shape one's ambitions, the author seems to suggest that it can, and that it might be more effective to leverage the environment rather than fighting against it. The author uses the example of Leonardo da Vinci being unable to ""beat the force of environment"" in Milan, implying that the environment plays a significant role in shaping one's opportunities and potential for success.

In conclusion, the passage highlights the diverse messages that different cities send and the influence these messages can have on individual ambitions and career paths.

These plates are pieces of the Earth's crust and upper mantle that float on the semi-fluid layer beneath, the asthenosphere. They move due to convection currents within the planet's mantle. 

The continents sit atop the plates, and move along with them. This movement causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. The continents themselves are actually broken up into smaller land masses called microcontinents. 

There are seven traditional continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. With the discovery of the Australian continent, the theory of continental drift was confirmed. The theory was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. He noticed that the coastlines of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like puzzle pieces. He also noticed that the rock layers in Greenland and Norway were similar. He concluded that the continents must have once been joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. 

Over millions of years, the continents broke apart and drifted to their current locations. Today, the continents continue to move, albeit very slowly. The continents will eventually collide and form a new supercontinent, called Pangea II, in about 300 million years."

The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

Fleming was working at St. Mary's Hospital in London when he noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria he had been studying. He observed that the area around the mold showed no bacterial growth, which led him to conclude that the mold must be secreting some substance that inhibits bacterial growth.

Fleming published his findings in 1928, describing the phenomenon as ""a new antibiotic substance produced by a fungus."" However, it wasn't until Howard Florey and Ernst Chain further developed the process of mass-producing penicillin during World War II that it became widely used for treating bacterial infections. Their work led to the first clinical use of penicillin in 1941, marking a significant advancement in medicine and saving countless lives during the war."

For example, at higher elevations where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at a lower temperature, typically around 99 degrees Celsius (210.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Conversely, at lower elevations with higher atmospheric pressure, water may boil at a higher temperature, potentially up to about 101.4 degrees Celsius (214.5 degrees Fahrenheit)."
4,3,Zero Context,0,Which artist cut off his own ear?,47.82717299461365,1,"Vincent van Gogh, the Dutch post-impressionist painter, famously cut off part of his own ear in December 1888. The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

These plates are pieces of the Earth's crust and upper mantle that float on the semi-fluid layer beneath, the asthenosphere. They move due to convection currents within the planet's mantle. 

The continents sit atop the plates, and move along with them. This movement causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. The continents themselves are actually broken up into smaller land masses called microcontinents. 

There are seven traditional continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. With the discovery of the Australian continent, the theory of continental drift was confirmed. The theory was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. He noticed that the coastlines of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like puzzle pieces. He also noticed that the rock layers in Greenland and Norway were similar. He concluded that the continents must have once been joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea.

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.
- **Florence**: The passage mentions that practically every fifteenth-century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, suggesting that it was a hub for artistic talent during that period.

The passage also discusses the idea that the environment or city one lives in can significantly influence one's ambitions and opportunities. It suggests that certain cities, like Cambridge, attract people who are interested in living in close proximity to the smartest people, despite the challenges such as high cost of living, grubbiness, and bad weather.

Regarding the question of whether the environment can shape one's ambitions, the author seems to suggest that it can, and that it might be more effective to leverage the environment rather than fighting against it. The author uses the example of Leonardo da Vinci being unable to ""beat the force of environment"" in Milan, implying that the environment plays a significant role in shaping one's opportunities and potential for success.

In conclusion, the passage highlights the diverse messages that different cities send and the influence these messages can have on individual ambitions and career paths.

- **New York**: The message here is that you should make more money. It emphasizes financial success and wealth.
- **Boston/Cambridge**: The message here is that you should be smarter. It highlights the importance of education and intellectual pursuits.
- **Silicon Valley**: The message is that you should be more powerful, focusing on impact and influence, particularly in technology and innovation.

He observed that the area around the mold showed no bacterial growth, which led him to conclude that the mold must be secreting some substance that inhibits bacterial growth.

Fleming published his findings in 1928, describing the phenomenon as ""a new antibiotic substance produced by a fungus."" However, it wasn't until Howard Florey and Ernst Chain further developed the process of mass-producing penicillin during World War II that it became widely used for treating bacterial infections.

The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. Despite his troubled life, van Gogh's art has had a profound impact on the art world, and he is now considered one of the most influential artists in history."

The incident took place at his home in the French town of Arles, where he was living at the time. Van Gogh's mental health had been deteriorating for some time, and this act is often attributed to his struggles with mental illness.

The exact circumstances surrounding the event are not entirely clear, but it is believed that van Gogh became involved in an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, who was also living with him at the time. The tension between the two artists had been building for several weeks, and the argument likely escalated into violence, leading to van Gogh cutting off part of his left ear.

Van Gogh later placed the severed ear in a jar filled with wine and gave it to a local brothel madam named Rachel, who lived nearby. He told her that it was a gift for Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh himself did not keep the severed ear; instead, he sent it to his sister Wil in The Hague, Netherlands, with a note saying, ""I have cut off my ear because of my troubles.""

After the incident, van Gogh was admitted to a mental institution, where he spent the last year of his life. He died by suicide on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37.

These plates are pieces of the Earth's crust and upper mantle that float on the semi-fluid layer beneath, the asthenosphere. They move due to convection currents within the planet's mantle. 

The continents sit atop the plates, and move along with them. This movement causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. The continents themselves are actually broken up into smaller land masses called microcontinents. 

There are seven traditional continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. With the discovery of the Australian continent, the theory of continental drift was confirmed. The theory was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. He noticed that the coastlines of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like puzzle pieces. He also noticed that the rock layers in Greenland and Norway were similar. He concluded that the continents must have once been joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. 

Over millions of years, the continents broke apart and drifted to their current locations. Today, the continents continue to move, albeit very slowly. The continents will eventually collide and form a new supercontinent, called Pangea II, in about 300 million years."

The continents sit atop the plates, and move along with them. This movement causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. The continents themselves are actually broken up into smaller land masses called microcontinents. 

There are seven traditional continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. With the discovery of the Australian continent, the theory of continental drift was confirmed. The theory was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. He noticed that the coastlines of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like puzzle pieces. He also noticed that the rock layers in Greenland and Norway were similar. He concluded that the continents must have once been joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. 

Over millions of years, the continents broke apart and drifted to their current locations. Today, the continents continue to move, albeit very slowly. The continents will eventually collide and form a new supercontinent, called Pangea II, in about 300 million years."
